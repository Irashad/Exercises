This interface allows you to perform some action before and after
a method has been executed. This listener gets invoked for configuration
and test methods. This TestNG listener in Selenium WebDriver works same as the
 ITestListerner and the ISuiteListerner. However, there is a difference that you
 should make a note of & that is, in IInvokedMethodListener, it makes the call before
  and after every method.

There are two methods to be implemented:

beforeInvocation(): This method is invoked prior every method.

afterInvocation(): This method is invoked post every method.

Here is sample code for this listener, implemented at class level.
