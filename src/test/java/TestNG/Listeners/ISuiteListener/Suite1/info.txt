This TestNG listener in Selenium WebDriver is implemented at a suite level called ISuiteListener. It has 2 methods:

onStart: This method is invoked prior the test suite execution.

onFinish: This method is invoked post the test suite execution.

This listener basically listen to the events to have occurred before and after the execution of the suite.If the
parent suite further contains
 child suites then child suites are executed before running the parent suite.
