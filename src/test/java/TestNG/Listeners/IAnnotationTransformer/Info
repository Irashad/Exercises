IAnnotationTransformer is an interface that provides a method
“transform” which would get invoked by TestNG to modify the behaviour of Test annotation method in our test class.
The transform method provides various parameters:

1.annotation: The annotation that would get read from the test class.
2. testClass: If the annotation found on a class, this parameter would represent that same class.
3. testConstructor: If the annotation found on a constructor, this parameter would represent that same constructor.
4. testMethod: If the annotation found on a method, this parameter would represent that same method.
Note: At least one of the parameters will be non-null.

Below is the sample code that would be executed at the suite level.
In this code, we have used a parameter “alwaysRun = true” in our Test annotation that indicates that the test
method would always run even if the parameters on which the method depends fails. However, we would transform
this behaviour of our test method through IAnnotationTransformer Listener which won’t allow the particular test method
to get executed.
